## What's left to do — eligibility checklist

| # | Item | Owner | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Upload governor ID for identity verification | User | 🔴 yes |
| 2 | App icon — real 512×512 PNG (current `assets/icon.json` is placeholder) | Agent | ✅ done — `assets/icon.png` (1024×1024 master), `distribution/play-graphics/icon-512.png` (512×512 store upload) |
| 3 | Adaptive icon — 432×432 foreground PNG | Agent | ✅ done — `assets/adaptive-icon.png` (432×432, transparent bg) |
| 4 | Feature graphic — 1024×500 PNG | Agent | ✅ done — `distribution/play-graphics/feature-graphic.png` |
| 5 | At least 2 phone screenshots (1080×1920 or similar) | Agent | ✅ done — `distribution/play-graphics/phone-{01,02,03}.png` (1080×2400 each; 3 screens: connection, chat, diff viewer) |
| 6 | Privacy policy — live at https://dzianisv.github.io/opencode-mobile/privacy/ | Agent | ✅ done — live & verified (HTTP 200) on gh-pages; `distribution/privacy-policy.html` (source), `distribution/privacy-policy.md` (markdown mirror) |
| 7 | Data safety form answers (drafted in `distribution/play-listing.md`) | User (in Console after app created) | ⚠️ **re-submit required (#143)** — Google rejected `cc.agentlabs.opencode` on 2026-07-22 because the Data Safety declaration did not disclose collection of Email Address (the "OpenCode Connect" waitlist on the Connect screen collects an email and forwards it to Brevo). Fixed in repo: `distribution/play-listing.md` Data Safety table now declares "Personal info — Email address" (collected, shared with Brevo, optional, purpose account management), and `distribution/privacy-policy.md`/`.html` + `docs/privacy/index.html` now disclose it. See resubmission steps in `PUBLISHING.md` § "Resubmitting after a Data Safety rejection". Also still declare "App interactions" + "Device or other IDs" as collected, optional, shared with PostHog/Sentry; "User-submitted diagnostic reports" as collected, optional, shared with our self-hosted Chatwoot inbox. See `docs/analytics.md` |
| 8 | Content rating questionnaire (IARC, drafted) | User (in Console after app created) | ✅ verified — no violence/sexual/gambling/UGC; "interact with other users" = No (user talks to own AI agent) |
| 9 | App access — reviewer instructions for self-hosted opencode (drafted) | User | ✅ verified — instructions accurate; `npm install -g opencode-ai && opencode serve` flow confirmed in `play-listing.md` |
| 10 | Sentry opt-in consent gate (for F-Droid parity + GDPR friendly) | Agent | ✅ done — `src/lib/telemetry.ts` (consent store), `src/components/TelemetryConsentModal.tsx` (first-launch modal), `app/_layout.tsx` (gated init), `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` (Privacy section toggle) |
| 11 | Closed testing recruitment — 12+ testers, 14 days | User | ⏸ post-Internal-track |

## Publishing process (after identity verified)

1. (manual) Setup → API access → Link `opencode-mobile-deploy`. Grant `playstore-deploy@…` "Release to production, exclude devices, and use Play App Signing".
2. (manual) Create app `ai.opencode.mobile`. Fill listing from `distribution/play-listing.md`.
3. (manual) Upload graphic assets + privacy policy URL.
4. (manual) Complete Data safety + Content rating + App access forms.
5. (manual, first time only) Upload `app-release.aab` to Internal testing track → add tester emails → publish.
6. (automated thereafter) `git tag v0.2.x && git push --tags` → CI builds + publishes to Internal.

After 14 days on Closed testing with 12+ active testers → promote to Production.

### Tagging a release publishes to Production (since AGE-110)

Pushing a `v*` tag (or publishing a GitHub Release) now uploads straight to the
**production** track with `status: completed`. Only `workflow_dispatch` honours
the `track`/`status` inputs, which still default to `internal`/`completed` for
dry runs.

Why the default flipped: while tag pushes stopped at `internal`, production kept
serving versionCode **136 (v0.4.5, 2026-06-22) for eight weeks**, because the
second manual dispatch was easy to forget. Sentry release health then showed
~64–78% of active users pinned to a single stale build, which capped the AGE-105
noise gate at a fraction of the error volume it was written to remove. The
human gate was not protecting users; it was silently withholding fixes from them.

Ad-hoc dry run (unchanged):

```bash
gh workflow run publish-play-store.yml --ref main -f track=internal -f status=draft
```

Every run **rebuilds** the AAB, so it gets its own versionCode
(`github.run_number + 100`) — it never promotes an existing artifact in place,
and it is never equal to `app.json`'s committed `android.versionCode`.

### Release history (production track)

| Version | Internal versionCode (tag push) | Production versionCode | Production rollout (UTC) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.4.13 | 148 (run 48, cancelled) | **149** (run 49, dispatch) | 2026-08-14 09:20 | waitlist retry queue (#166) |
| v0.4.14 | 150 (run 50) | **151** (run 51, dispatch) | 2026-08-14 14:22 | Sentry client-side noise gate (#169) — post-deploy Sentry measurement window for AGE-105 starts at this date, not at merge |
| v0.4.15 | — | **153** (run 53, **tag push**) | 2026-08-14 17:58 | In-app update check for non-Play installs (#179). First release to reach production **without a dispatch** — #177 verified in the wild: run [31824702844](https://github.com/dzianisv/opencode-mobile/actions/runs/31824702844) logged `event=push -> track=production status=completed`. Code 152 (run 52, 17:04) was the same version from the pre-#180 tag, superseded by 153 |

## Acquisition metrics — trusted source

There is currently no verified, least-privilege source wired up for Play
Store acquisition/uninstall metrics (installs, uninstalls, store listing
conversion). `scripts/product-intelligence.mjs` explicitly lists this as a
**deferred** metric until a proper reporting contract exists — do not treat
ad-hoc Play Console screenshots or manual exports as a trusted feed for
automated reporting.

Until that's implemented, the Play Console UI
(https://play.google.com/console/u/2/developers/8842655543970815326) is the
only source of truth for acquisition numbers, checked manually. Review
volume/rating triage (a related but separate signal) is automated via
`.github/workflows/triage-reviews.yml` + `scripts/triage-reviews.py`, which
reads reviews through the Android Publisher API using the
`PLAY_STORE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` GitHub secret (see "Linked GCP resources"
above) — this is the trusted source for review-based signals, not any
scraped or manually copied review text.

## Sibling channels: F-Droid + IzzyOnDroid

OpenCode Mobile is also distributed via F-Droid (mainline) and IzzyOnDroid —
the two primary OSS Android app stores for privacy-conscious users.

All three channels use the **same signing key and same package id** (`ai.opencode.mobile`),
so users can update in-place across stores.

Submission packets (ready to file after the first Play release is live):

- `distribution/fdroid-submission/` — F-Droid mainline MR packet
  - `metadata.yml` — ready-to-PR fdroiddata metadata
  - `SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` — step-by-step MR filing guide
  - `REPRODUCIBLE-BUILD-NOTES.md` — reproducibility audit + fixes needed
  - `SIZE-OPTIMIZATION.md` — APK ABI splits + FCM flavor documentation
- `distribution/izzyondroid-submission/` — IzzyOnDroid inclusion request packet
  - `INCLUSION-REQUEST.md` — ready-to-paste Codeberg issue body
  - `SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` — step-by-step filing guide
- `distribution/SIGNING-KEY-FINGERPRINTS.md` — signing key SHA-256 fingerprints
- `docs/fdroid.md` — operational doc for F-Droid / IzzyOnDroid (mirrors this doc)

Timeline: IzzyOnDroid 1–3 days after first APK on GitHub releases.
F-Droid mainline 4–12 weeks after MR filed.
