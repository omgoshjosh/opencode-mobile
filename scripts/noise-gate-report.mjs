/**
 * Did the Sentry noise gate actually cut the volume? — the honest version.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `scripts/sentry-volume-report.mjs` answers "how many events/month is the org
 * consuming". That number alone CANNOT grade the gate (AGE-105), because the gate
 * ships inside an app binary and only runs on devices that installed it.
 *
 * On 2026-08-14 the gate went to Play production (versionCode 151). Replaying 90d
 * of this project's real events through the gate drops 96.9% of them, which
 * predicts ~87 events/month — but ONLY once every user is on a gated build. Play
 * uptake takes days-to-weeks and never reaches 100%.
 *
 * So a naive read on 2026-08-17 ("still 2,000/month, the gate failed") is a
 * measurement error, not a finding: if a third of the install base has upgraded,
 * the honest expectation is ~2/3 of the baseline, and 2,000 is a PASS. The
 * reverse mistake is just as easy — a drop caused by fewer users opening the app
 * over a weekend, read as gate efficacy.
 *
 * This script folds Play's version share into the comparison:
 *
 *   expected_post = baseline_rate x (1 - gated_share x efficacy)
 *
 * and grades the measured post rate against THAT, not against the endpoint. It
 * also reports the endpoint (`fullUptakeProjection`) so the answer to "will this
 * clear the 3,500/month org gate when uptake completes" is separate from "is it
 * on track today".
 *
 * NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR GATE LIVENESS. `client_discard/before_send > 0` proves the
 * gate is running on real devices and is independent of install share — it shows
 * up first. This script surfaces it and refuses to grade a window without it.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=... GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=... \
 *     node scripts/noise-gate-report.mjs \
 *       --pre  2026-08-14T07:00:00Z..2026-08-14T14:00:00Z \
 *       --post 2026-08-17T00:00:00Z..now
 *
 *   --json            machine-readable
 *   --no-play         skip Play (grades at gated_share=0, i.e. "no credit for uptake")
 *   --project SLUG    default opencode-mobile
 *
 * Neither credential lives on a laptop. Run it through
 * `.github/workflows/sentry-noise-gate-report.yml` (workflow_dispatch), which has
 * both as repo secrets and writes the table to the run summary.
 *
 * Exit code is 0 for any *readable* result — an unmet target is a finding to
 * report, not a crash. Non-zero only when the data cannot be obtained.
